/* Notes
A value is a piece of data. It is the most fundamental unit of information that we  have in programming.

Naming Variables .
variable names cannot start with a number 
variable names can only contain numbers , letters, underscores or the dolllar sign.
Always write your variables with camel casing.
Don't use reserved keywords as variable name e.g(name)
Don't start a variable name with an Uppercase letter
write constants with upper case later
Make sure your variable names are descriptive(EASY TO UNDERSTAND).
Do this:
let myFirstJob = "Programmer";
let mySecondJob = "Teacher";

Don't do this
job1 = "Teacher";
job2 = "programmer";


Primitive Data Types 
Number: FLoating point numbers (Use for decimals and integers) let age = 23;
String: Sequence of characters (Used for Text) let firstname = "Jonas";
Boolean: Logical type that can only be true or false (Used for taking decisions)let fullAge = true;
undefined: value taken by a variable that is not yet defined(empty value) let children;
Null: Also means 'empty value'
Symbol (ES2015): value that is unique and cannot be changed.
BgInt(ES2020): Larger Integers than the Number can hold. 

Note that it is the value that holds the data type not the variable

Let, Const and Var Variables

Let and var variables can be redeclared i.e (mutable) but const cannot be redeclared i.e (immutable)

let age = 30;
age = 34;

const P! = 3.141234

var mybirthday = 'September'
myBirthday = 'August 20'

Basic Operators in Javascript

Math operator
// Math operators
const now = 2037;
const ageJonas = now - 1991;
const ageSarah = now - 2018;
console.log(ageJonas, ageSarah);

console.log(ageJonas * 2, ageJonas / 10, 2 ** 3);
// 2 ** 3 means 2 to the power of 3 = 2 * 2 * 2

const firstName = 'Jonas';
const lastName = 'Schmedtmann';
console.log(firstName + ' ' + lastName);

// Assignment operators
let x = 10 + 5; // 15
x += 10; // x = x + 10 = 25
x *= 4; // x = x * 4 = 100
x++; // x = x + 1
x--;
x--;
console.log(x);

// Comparison operators
console.log(ageJonas > ageSarah); // >, <, >=, <=
console.log(ageSarah >= 18);

const isFullAge = ageSarah >= 18;

console.log(now - 1991 > now - 2018);

Typeof operator

const lastName = "Schmedtmann";
console.log(typeof lastName);

// Challenge 1

/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
3. Create a boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

TEST DATA 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
TEST DATA 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

GOOD LUCK üòÄ */

/*
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:

1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message can be either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

HINT: Use an if/else statement üòâ

// Coding Challenge #3

/*
There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins the a trophy!

1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that as well (draw means they have the same average score).

3. BONUS 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points. HINT: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks üòâ
4. BONUS 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy.

TEST DATA: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
TEST DATA BONUS 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123
